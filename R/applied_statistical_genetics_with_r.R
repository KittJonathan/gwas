# 1.1 Overview of population-based investigations

# 1.1.1 Types of investigations

# Population-based genetic association studies can be divided roughly into four categories of studies:
# a. candidate polymorphism
# b. candidate gene
# c. fine mapping
# d. whole or partial genome-wide scans

# 1.1.2 Genotype versus gene expression

# Genotype = a categorical variable that takes on values from a predefined set of discrete characters
# Trait  measure of disease status or disease progress

# In population association studies, genotype = predictor variable & trait = dependent variable

# 1.1.3 Population- versus family-based investigations

# Individuals within the same family are likely to be more similar than are individuals from different families
# Allelic phase (= alignment of nucleotides on a single homolog) is typically unobservable in population-based association studies

# 1.1.4 Association versus population genetics

# Population genetics refers generally to the study of changes in the genetic composition of a population that occur
# over time and under evolutionary pressures (eg study of natural selection and genetic drift)

# 1.2 Data components and terminology

# Data arising from population-based genetic association studies are generally comprised of three components:
# (1) the genotype of the organism under investigation
# (2) a single trait or multiple traits (or phenotypes) that are associated with disease progression or disease status
# (3) patient-specific covariates (treatment history, additional clinical and demographic information)
