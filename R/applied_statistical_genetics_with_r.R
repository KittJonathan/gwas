# 1.1 Overview of population-based investigations

# 1.1.1 Types of investigations

# Population-based genetic association studies can be divided roughly into four categories of studies:
# a. candidate polymorphism
# b. candidate gene
# c. fine mapping
# d. whole or partial genome-wide scans

# 1.1.2 Genotype versus gene expression

# Genotype = a categorical variable that takes on values from a predefined set of discrete characters
# Trait  measure of disease status or disease progress

# In population association studies, genotype = predictor variable & trait = dependent variable

# 1.1.3 Population- versus family-based investigations

# Individuals within the same family are likely to be more similar than are individuals from different families
